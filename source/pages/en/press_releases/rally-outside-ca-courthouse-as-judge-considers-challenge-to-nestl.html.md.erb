*Activists Rally Outside Federal Courthouse in Riverside as
Judge Considers Challenge to Nestlé Water-Bottling Pipeline in the San
Bernardino National Forest*

*Nestlé Under Fire for Siphoning Millions of Gallons of Water from
Bernardino National Forest Despite Expired Permit; Harming Creek*

RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA -- On June, 13, 2016, activists from the Story of
Stuff Project, the California-based Courage Campaign Institute and the
Center for Biological Diversity will rally outside the U.S. District Court
building in Riverside, Calif. as Judge Jesus G. Bernal considers a
challenge to Nestlé’s four-mile pipeline that siphons water from San
Bernardino National Forest’s Strawberry Creek to bottling operations in
Ontario, California. In a time of drought and water conservation, Nestlé’s
operation has severely lowered levels in Strawberry Creek, harming wildlife
and the public interest.

At the rally, activists will call on the Court to rule against the US
Forest Service for allowing Nestlé to continue to bottle millions of
gallons of water from the San Bernardino National Forest with a permit that
expired 28 years ago, effectively ending Nestlé water-taking.

WHEN:  8:00am PDT, Monday, June 13

WHERE: U.S. District Court - Courtroom 1, 3470 Twelfth Street, Riverside, CA.

In 2014 alone, an estimated 28 million gallons were piped away from the
forest to be bottled and sold under Nestlé’s Arrowhead brand of bottled
water.  The permit expired in 1988 but the piping system remains in active
use, siphoning about 68,000 gallons of water a day out of the forest last
year. Reports from the end of 2015 indicated that water levels at
Strawberry Creek were at record lows.

In exchange for allowing Nestlé to continue siphoning water from the Creek,
the Forest Service receives just $524 a year, less than the average
Californian’s water bill.

Following the announcement of the lawsuit last year, the Forest Service
announced plans to review and renew Nestlé's permit for another five
years.  Earlier this month, more than 280,000 members of the
California-based Courage Campaign Institute, The Story of Stuff Project,
the Center for Biological Diversity, Food & Water Watch, Care2, CREDO,
SumOfUs and Daily Kos and many other groups and individuals submitted
comments to the Forest Service requesting that the Forest Service not
approve Nestlé’s new permit for water bottling in the San Bernardino
National Forest.

“Forest Service must follow the law (of the National Environmental Policy
Act) and conduct a robust and rigorous environmental review of the impacts
of Nestle’s bottled water operation on our lands before issuing a new
permit,” explained Eddie Kurtz, executive director and President of the
California-based Courage Campaign. “Until a new permit is issued and while
this review is under way,Nestle should not be allowed to withdraw water
from the forest.”

“Why should Nestle - the largest food and beverage company in the U.S. -
get to operate a huge bottled water operation on a permit that’s been
expired for 30 years during a historic drought when it is causing what used
to be a perennial stream that wildlife use to go dry?” said Ileene
Anderson, senior scientist and public lands deserts director for the Center
for Biological Diversity.

“280,000+ citizens have signed a petition demanding that the Forest
Service turn off the spigot,” explained Michael O’Heaney, Executive
Director at Story of Stuff.  “Extending Nestle’s permit without a proper
environmental review disregards the public interest and threatens the well
being of the plants and animals that depend on the water.”
