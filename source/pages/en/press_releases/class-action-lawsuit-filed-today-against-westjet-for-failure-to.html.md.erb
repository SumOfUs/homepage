*Class Action Lawsuit Filed Today Against WestJet for Failure to Address
Sexual Harassment and Assault*

*SumofUs responds to class action lawsuit filed against Canadian airline
WestJet*

Today, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of all female flight
attendants at WestJet, alleging that the company breached its employment
contract with all female flight attendants by failing to create and
maintain a workplace free from harassment. The class includes current and
former flight attendants.

This class action suit follows a separate lawsuit filed last month by
former flight attendant Mandalena Lewis, after WestJet failed to properly
investigate her report of a sexual assault.

Responding to the announcement of a class-action lawsuit against WestJet,
Emma Pullman, Lead Campaign Strategist for SumOfUs.org issued the following
statement:

“It’s very concerning that more and more women are coming forward with
stories of sexual harassment at WestJet. According to former and current
employees, WestJet has failed to acknowledge, prevent, or adequately
address sexual harassment and assault within the airline.

Ultimately, Mr. Sarestky should take responsibility by resigning. WestJet
needs new leadership to reform the company’s policies and create a safe
work environment for all employees. Tens of thousands of Canadians —
including WestJet customers, employees, shareholders and frequent flyers —
are demanding change at WestJet and have called on WestJet CEO Greg
Saretsky to resign. We  will be watching to see that WestJet is tackling
this seriously.”

To date, more than 28,000 SumOfUs members in Canada have signed onto a
petition calling for WestJet CEO Greg Sarestky to step down, and for the
airline to institute comprehensive policies that reform reporting and
prevention of sexual assault in the future. This includes over 15,000
WestJet customers, and thousands of frequent flyers and shareholders.
