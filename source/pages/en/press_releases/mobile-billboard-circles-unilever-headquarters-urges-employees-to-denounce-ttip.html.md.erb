*Mobile Billboard Reading “U Against TTIP” Circles Unilever Headquarters, Urges Employees to Denounce TTIP*

*Corporate watchdog SumOfUs commissions mobile billboard targeting Unilever*

London, UK — On Wednesday, May 11th, a mobile billboard will circle the
headquarters of consumer goods giant Unilever from 9am to 5pm, asking
employees to take a stance against the Transatlantic Trade Investment
Partnership (TTIP), a trade deal between the United States and European
Union. The deal is said to exclude environmental safeguards and would allow
companies to sue governments over environmental protection policies*.*

Unilever has committed to sustainable business practices in the past,
touting leadership in the fight against climate change. However, the
company is alsoan influential member of FoodDrinkEurope, a pro-corporate
lobby group pushing for the passage of TTIP.

“Unilever is a company that has committed to doing business sustainably and
called for action to tackle climate change. Yet Unilever is one of the
companies pushing for TTIP as a member of lobbying group
FoodDrinkEurope,” said Wiebke Schroeder, campaigner at SumOfUs. “That is why SumOfUs members are
calling on Unilever to rethink their support for the deal.”

Over 150,000 SumOfUs members have called for Unilever to re-think their
support of TTIP. This past weekend, thousands of SumOfUs members donated to
crowd fund advertising outside Unilever’s London offices, encouraging
employees to ask questions about their bosses’ stance on TTIP.

“TTIP is being negotiated behind closed doors by politicians and corporate
lobbyists,” said Schroeder. “Most of what we know about this secret deal we
know from leaks -- and those leaks suggest that the deal would be
incredibly damaging to our democracies and the environment. If passed, TTIP
will jeopardise vital environmental and health regulations and threaten
working standards in Europe, allowing corporations to sue governments
behind closed doors.”

The organization will be targeting a host of companies in Europe and the US
over the coming months, challenging them to make their position on TTIP
clear - and calling on them to oppose the deal where it conflicts with
their position on climate change, and other critical issues.
