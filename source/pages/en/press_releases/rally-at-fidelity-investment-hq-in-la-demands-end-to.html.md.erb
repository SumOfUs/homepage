According to international law and official US policy, Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal. The Israeli settlement enterprise is part of a decades-old military occupation that has confiscated=C2=A042%  of Palestinian land in the West Bank for settlement construction, resulting in the loss of freedom of movement and other severe human rights abuses against the Palestinian people.=20

Earlier this year, the=C2=A0Associated Press reported  that Airbnb had been allowing Israeli settlers in the West Bank to list their homes as =E2=80=9Cin Israel=E2=80=9D with no mention that they are on occupied Palestinian land. In addition to misleading potential renters and aiding the Israeli government in laying permanent claim to all the land under its control, some of the proprietors have=C2=A0explicitly discriminated against people with Arab or Palestinian names , in direct violation of=C2=A0Airbnb=E2=80=99s stated policies.  =20

A=C2=A0Human Rights Watch report  published in January stated that businesses should withdraw from the settlements to end their complicity in "an inherently unlawful and abusive system that violates the rights of Palestinians." That same month, Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, sent=C2=A0a letter  to Airbnb chief executive Brian Chesky warning that Airbnb is =E2=80=9Ceffectively promoting the illegal Israeli colonization of occupied land.=E2=80=9D

Ahead of the deliveries, the members of the coalition sent a letter  to key Airbnb investor, Fidelity Investments, informing the investment firm that Airbnb facilitates and benefits from the transfer of Israeli civilians into occupied territory, which is forbidden under international law. The action at Fidelity Investment Headquarters in Boston in particular will target CEO Abigail Johnson, the richest woman in Boston and the 6th richest woman in America. Her investment in Airbnb means that she too is profiting off stolen Palestinian land.=20

Last month, the UN announced  that it would establish a database of all companies implicated in Israel=E2=80=99s illegal settlement enterprise in the occupied Palestinian West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Unless Airbnb immediately delists Israeli settlement rentals in the West Bank, they will be included in the first draft of the database to be released in June.

With Israel=E2=80=99s brutal military occupation now entering its 50th year this weekend, the coalition chose this date to stand with Palestinians in their struggle for freedom, justice, and equality. This particular anniversary highlights that Israel has denied Palestinians their most basic human rights for too long and Airbnb investors must use their unique position to influence Airbnb to end its complicity.=20

Last week, the coalition launched a video  called We Can=E2=80=99t Live There. So Don=E2=80=99t Go There, featuring Palestinians speaking directly to Airbnb=E2=80=99s new marketing campaign Don=E2=80=99t Go There. Live There, and urging potential travelers not to rent vacation homes in settlements, which are often not clearly identified as such in the website=E2=80=99s listings.  The coalition also launched a microsite  parodying Airbnb rental listings and calling attention to the the fact that the vacation rental company continues to list Israeli settlements in the West Bank. More than 150,000 people have also signed onto a petition from SumOfUs demanding Airbnb take immediate action to delist Israeli settlement rental properties.
