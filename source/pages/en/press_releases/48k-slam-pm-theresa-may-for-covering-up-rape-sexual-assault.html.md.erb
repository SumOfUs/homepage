*48,000 Slam PM Theresa May for Covering-Up Rape, Sexual Assault at Yarl’s
Wood Detention Center*

*SumOfUs Demands Prime Minister May, Serco Release of Information on Human
Rights Abuses*

In a petition from corporate accountability watchdog SumOfUs, signatories
are calling on UK Prime Minister Theresa May to release information
regarding human rights abuses at the private immigrant detention center
Yarl’s Wood.

Owned by the UK-based outsourcing giant Serco, Yarl’s Wood houses hundreds
of female detainees, 70% of whom are survivors of sexual assault. Last
year, a report found that more than half of the women detained at Yarl’s
Wood feel unsafe. Allegations of rape, sexual abuse and intimidation are
rife, and some of the alleged victims have even been deported after
speaking up about their experiences before they could testify to police.

“Theresa May and Serco’s secrecy surrounding sexual assault at Yarl’s Wood
is deplorable and unacceptable,” said Sondhya Gupta, campaigner at SumOfUs.
“In her bid to become our new Prime Minister, May claimed that ‘big
business needs to change’ so the country ‘works for everyone — not just the
privileged few’. But she is clearly acting in the best interest of Serco,
the giant corporation that runs Yarl’s Wood, and not the vulnerable women
she is supposed to protect.”

The UK’s Home Office is obliged by law to disclose information within the
public interest, yet the Prime Minister’s former department has refused  to
let that information be released.   Last year, the Home Office, under May’s
leadership also refused to let the UN’s Special Rapporteur on violence
against women into Yarl’s Wood.

“Corporations that provide public services must be held accountable. Serco
runs everything from detention centers to hospitals in the UK, and should
be held to the highest possible standards.   Prime Minister May must
deliver on her promises and protect the women in her care, rather than
Serco’s profits,” added Gupta.
