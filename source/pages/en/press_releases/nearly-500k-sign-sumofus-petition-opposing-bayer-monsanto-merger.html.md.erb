*Corporate Watchdog Warns of Potential Bayer/Monsanto Merger, as Bayer
Increases Its Bid for the US Agribusiness Giant*

*Nearly 500,000 Sign Petition Opposing Bayer/Monsanto Merger*

*SumOfUs Warns Bayer/Monsanto Merger Would Radically Threaten Global Food
Systems*

Earlier today, Germany’s Bayer AG expanded its takeover offer for Monsanto
to $65 billion in an effort to overcome Monsanto’s resistance to the
proposed merger.

In reaction to the news, Anne Isakowitsch, a Berlin-based campaigner for
SumOfUs, an international corporate watchdog issued the following statement:

“Bayer’s latest bid for Monsanto is a desperate attempt to make a
potentially illegal deal more palatable for Monsanto shareholders and
global consumers - but if this deal goes through it would spell disaster
for our food supply and farmers, ushering in a new era of sterile crops
soaked in dangerous pesticides.

“This new corporation would be the biggest seed maker and pesticide company
in the world -- defying important antitrust protections that would allow it
to control critical aspects of our food supply in a way that would
undermine consumer choices and the stability of farmers worldwide.

“Nearly 500,000 SumOfUs members around the world oppose this dangerous
merger and will continue to work to make sure that this deal never happens.”

Nearly 500,000 SumOfUs members around the world have signed onto a petition
opposing the potential merger of Monsanto and Bayer.

According to SumOfUs, the proposed merger would:

-  Consolidate corporate control of global food systems, undermining choice
   and raising prices for farmers and consumers alike. If a Bayer-Monsanto
   merger goes through, the new mega-corporation would have annual revenues of
   over $67 billion and would dominate a third of global markets in seed sales
   and crop protection. Monsanto seed traits are already found in 80% of corn
   and 90% of soybeans grown in the US. A Bayer-Monsanto mega corporation
   would add cotton seeds to this list, together controlling 70% of the US
   cotton market.

-  Threaten critical pollinators like bees and butterflies. Both Bayer and
   Monsanto are facing significant public opposition for pushing profits in
   the face of the environment and public health concerns. Bayer’s neonic
   pesticides are harming bee populations worldwide and Monsanto’s Roundup
   kills the main food source for Monarch butterflies, which are now at risk
   of extinction, and contains the pesticide Glyphosate which has been named
   as a probable source of cancer in humans by the WHO. Together, these
   controversial products would be backed by coordinated and well-funded
   lobbying tactics and a virtual monopoly on the development of marketable
   alternatives.

-  Run afoul of antitrust laws designed to protect the public. Merger
   regulations in the European Union prohibit mergers which would
   significantly reduce competition in the EU, for example if they would
   create dominant companies that are likely to raise prices for consumers.
   And US law bars mergers when the effect "may be substantially to lessen
   competition or to tend to create a monopoly." Given the consolidation
   already occurring in the first two links of the industrial food chain
   --seeds and pesticides--this merger is likely to violate antitrust statutes.
