*60,000 Outraged at Facebook for Censoring Korryn Gaines’ Account and Videos*

*Consumer Watchdog Demands Facebook CEO Clarify Position on Profile
Deactivation & Video Censorship at Police Request*

Nearly 60,000 members of SumOfUs, an international consumer watchdog, are
calling on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to clarify his company’s position
on the deactivation and censorship of personal profiles at the request of
the police.

The petition was launched after Facebook deactivated the account of Korryn
Gaines, a 23-year old black woman shot to death by Baltimore County police
on Monday, August 1st. Gaines was broadcasting the standoff that ultimately
led to her death and the injury of her 5 year-old son.

SumOfUs is also asking that Facebook adopt a public, transparent and
accountable policy that protects individual civil liberties in the face of
police requests for censorship.

“Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been a notable supporter of the Black
Lives Matter movement and issues of racial justice in the United States in
the past few years. That is exactly why it was so troubling to see that
Facebook actively censored Korryn Gaines’ account and videos of her murder
by police at the request of law enforcement officials,” explained Nicole
Carty, campaigner at SumOfUs. “In recent years, social media and shareable
video have been instrumental to raising awareness about the ongoing
epidemic of police violence against people of color in the United States.
But if Facebook censors this critical tool at the behest of the police,
that could all change.

SumOfUs argues that the introduction of Facebook Live puts Facebook in the
position to control one of the most powerful tools used to expose police
misconduct. Just last month, the Facebook livestream of Philando Castile’s
death at the hands of police sparked nationwide protests.

“If Facebook simply complies with police requests to suspend broadcasts and
accounts, it will be shielding police misbehavior from the public and
stifling free speech — not to mention cutting people off from crucial
support networks in the midst of deadly police encounters,” added Carty.
