*Antitrust Experts Warn Against Proposed Bayer-Monsanto Merger*

*Legal Opinion Questions the Legality of Bayer-Monsanto Merger on Antitrust
Grounds, Outlines Risks Posed by Merger*

A new legal opinion, written by two former Justice Department officials
from the Antitrust Division, argues that a merger between Bayer and
Monsanto would violate the Clayton Act, a law enacted by Congress to curb
anticompetitive business practices.

According to the white paper, a Bayer-Monsanto merger would also be in
direct violation of a 2008 court order, where Monsanto was forced to divest
itself of certain cottonseed and cotton breeding assets, which were sold to
Bayer. If the merger proceeds, Monsanto would re-acquire these
anti-competitive traits, thereby violating the US Department of Justice’s
judgement.

The legal opinion points out that:

- The merger would eliminate direct competition between two of the largest
   players in the traited seed sector, with direct consequences for seed
   development, herbicide markets, and innovative and open research and
   development.


- A merger will mean the new Bayer-Monsanto conglomerate will control
   nearly 70% of the cotton acreage in the United States – unacceptably high
   by antitrust standards. It would also have unacceptable market
   concentration in wide swaths of commercial seed development and sales for
   other commonly used varieties, including traited canola, soybeans, and corn
   developed in North America.


- The new corporation would likely lead to higher input prices, with less
   choice and higher food prices for consumers, and fewer non-biotechnology
   options available to farmers and consumers.

“A merger between Bayer and Monsanto is a five-alarm threat to our food
supply and to farmers around the world,” explained Anne Isakowitsch, Senior
Campaigner with SumOfUs.  “This new mega corporation would be the world’s
biggest seed maker and pesticide company, defying important antitrust
protections, giving it unacceptable control over critical aspects of our
food supply -- undermining consumer choice and the freedom and stability of
farmers worldwide.”

SumOfUs, an international corporate watchdog, released the legal opinion as
Bayer, a German chemical and pharmaceutical giant, increases its efforts to
acquire Monsanto, one of the world’s largest producers of chemicals and
farm inputs.

More than 500,000 SumOfUs members around the world have signed onto a
petition opposing the potential merger of Monsanto and Bayer.
