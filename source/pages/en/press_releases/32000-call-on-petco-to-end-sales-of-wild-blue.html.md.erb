*32,000 Call on Petco to End Sales of Wild Blue Tang “Finding Dory” Fish*

*Demand for the Threatened Fish Species Surges After Disney’s Popular Film
Sequel, “Finding Dory”*

More than 32,000 members of SumOfUs, an international corporate watchdog,
have signed onto a new petition calling on Petco to discontinue its sales
of wild Blue Tang fish as pets. Demand for the Blue Tang fish has surged
following Disney’s release of the film, “Finding Dory.”

Local Blue Tang populations are already threatened in the Indo-Pacific due
to illegal collection, as they are difficult to breed in captivity.

“The only way for breeders to meet the growing demand for Blue Tang fish as
pets is to illegally remove them from their natural habitats,” said Toni
Preston, campaigner for SumOfUs.* “As you can imagine, this is a
detrimental threat to sea life, as Blue Tangs are natural cleaners to our
oceans’ coral reefs and their surrounding habitats. If Petco continues to
sell the wild-caught Blue Tang as pets, our coral reefs will become even
more vulnerable to the effects of climate change.

“That’s why 13,000 Petco customers are asking Petco to stop selling wild
Blue Tangs as pets. Our oceans can’t afford it. Petco can,” added Preston.

SumOfUs has a history of leveraging consumer power to protect the world’s
precious coasts. Last year, SumOfUs members successfully pressured HSBC
Barclays and other major investors to pull out of funding a coal mine
project that threatened the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.
