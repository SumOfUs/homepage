*Suncor Shareholders Call for Greater Transparency Around Lobbying *

*Leading Proxy Advisors Support Resolution*

CALGARY -- On Thursday, April 28th, at the Annual General Meeting of Suncor
shareholders, advocates from consumer watchdog SumOfUs, representing Suncor
shareholders, will present a proposal calling on the company to disclose
payments made by Suncor Energy to corporate front groups and for lobbying
policymakers.

The shareholder resolution is intended to bring international standards of
transparency and accountability to the Canadian oil and gas sector. The
resolution asks Suncor to disclose payments it makes to lobbyists, trade associations, and
grassroots campaigns to influence public policy.

Leading independent proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services
and Glass Lewis & Co have recommended that shareholders vote in favor of
the proposal. In addition, thousands of Canadians wrote directly to their
pension funds asking them to vote FOR the proposal using the
VoteYourPension site.

“This groundbreaking shareholder proposal is a powerful tool to encourage
transparency at Suncor and in the oil sands sector more broadly,” said Emma
Pullman, Vancouver-based lead campaign strategist for SumOfUs. “We hope
Suncor shareholders vote for accountability today, because thousands of
Canadians don't want their mutual funds and retirement savings to fund
controversial lobbying tactics.”
