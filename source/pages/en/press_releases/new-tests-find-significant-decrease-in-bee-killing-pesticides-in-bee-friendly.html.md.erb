*New Tests Find Significant Decrease in Bee-Killing Pesticides in “Bee-Friendly” Plants*

*Poll shows 51 percent of Americans more likely to shop at retailers
committed to not sell bee-killing pesticides*

Washington, D.C. — A report released today showed a significant decrease
in the number of “bee-friendly” home garden plants sold at major
retailers that have been pre-treated with pesticides shown to harm and kill
bees. The study  of plants purchased at Home Depot (NYSE: HD), Lowe’s (NYSE: LOW), Ace Hardware, True
Value and Walmart (NYSE: WMT) was conducted by Friends of the Earth,
Pesticide Research Institute and allies.

The report, Gardeners Beware 2016, is a follow-up to testing conducted in
2013 and 2014 that demonstrated the presence of bee-toxic neonicotinoid insecticides
(neonics) in more than half of bee-attractive flowers tested. The 2016
analysis found that 23 percent of flowers and trees tested contain
neonicotinoid insecticides at levels that can harm or kill bees, indicating
that stores are selling far fewer plants treated with bee-killing neonics
than in 2014. This reduction is likely due to changes in store policies
that commit retailers to eliminate neonicotinoid use on garden plants.
Retailer commitments are having a ripple effect in production methods by
suppliers and have resulted in reduced use of neonicotinoids in common
garden plants overall.

Large retailers, including Home Depot and Lowe's, have made commitments to
phase out use of these pesticides. The new data demonstrates that these two
companies are making significant progress toward that goal. Ace Hardware,
True Value and Walmart have not yet made similar commitments to eliminate
neonics in their stores.

“The market is shifting away from selling bee-killing pesticides, and
retailers including Ace Hardware and True Value are lagging behind their
competitors,” said Tiffany Finck-Haynes, food futures campaigner with
Friends of the Earth. “We are calling on all retailers to do their part to
save bees and adopt formal policies to eliminate neonicotinoid pesticides.”

“Our data indicates that compared to two years ago, fewer nurseries and
garden stores are selling plants pre-treated with systemic neonicotinoid
insecticides,” said Susan Kegley, Ph.D., author of the report from the
Pesticide Research Institute. “Yet it’s still not possible for a gardener
to be sure that the plants they select at the store will be safe for bees
and other pollinators. Retailers should work with their suppliers to speed
up their phase out of bee-harming pesticides.”

A YouGov Poll commissioned by Friends of the Earth and SumofUs conducted in 2016 and released today
found that 67 percent of Americans feel more positively about Home Depot
and 66 percent  feel more positively about Lowe’s because of their formal
commitments to eliminate neonics.  Following this survey, half of
respondents said they are more likely to shop at Home Depot (50 percent)
and Lowe’s (51 percent) because of the store’s commitment. Further, more
than a third (39 percent) said they’d feel more negatively about a retailer
that had not formally committed to eliminate systemic neonicotinoid
insecticides.

"Our poll shows clearly that hardware store customers care about using
neonic-free plants,” said Angus Wong, Lead Digital Strategist at SumOfUs.
“Given this evidence, it's no wonder that hundreds of thousands of
Americans have signed petitions asking Ace and True Value Hardware stores
to follow in Home Depot and Lowe’s footsteps by pulling neonicotinoid
insecticides from their shelves and committing to stock products that do
not harm bees. While True Value and Ace Hardware affiliates in Maine,
Oregon and Washington have adopted store policies to eliminate
neonicotinoids, both chains must adopt policies that apply to all of their
stores nationwide.”

More than 100 businesses, cities, universities, states and countries around
the world have restricted use of these insecticides. Greenhouse Grower’s
2016 State Of The Industry Survey found 74 percent of growers who supply mass merchants and home improvement
chains said they will not use neonicotinoid insecticides in 2016.

"Not just pollinators are affected by neonicotinoid pesticides. The men and
women farmworkers who work in the nurseries and on the farms that grow the
plants that bees and insects pollinate are also exposed to and at high
risk from these pesticides, that have been shown to have environmental and
human health effects,” said Jeannie Economos, Pesticide Safety and
Environmental Health Project Coordinator, Farmworker Association of
Florida. “Even their children living in these agricultural areas are
threatened by toxic exposures.  We need urgent action. When we protect
pollinators, we also protect farmworkers, children, and, ultimately,
ourselves."

Bees and other pollinators, essential for every one in three bites of food
we eat, are in great peril. The United Nations estimates 40 percent of
invertebrate pollinator species, including bees and butterflies, are on the
brink of extinction. Research indicates that bee-toxic neonicotinoid
insecticides are one of the primary causes of the decline. Neonicotinoid
insecticides have been responsible for several high profile bee kills from
high doses of the pesticides, and a strong and growing body of science
shows that neonics contribute to impaired reproduction, learning and
memory, hive communications and immune response at doses far below those
that cause bee kills. In this study, all of the nursery plant samples where
neonics were detected have the potential to harm or even kill bees.

Flowering trees are frequently used in landscaping city streets and
business campuses, providing nectar for bees, seeds for birds and shade for
humans. Unfortunately, the results of the new report show that systemic
neonicotinoids are commonly used in tree production and could be a major
source of exposure for urban pollinators.
