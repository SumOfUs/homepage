“More and more evidence has shown that over the last 8 years, WestJet has
failed to adequately prevent or address sexual harassment and assault
within the company - having continuously swept under the rug  allegations
of sexual assault and rape by its employees against its employees.   This
must end,” explained Emma Pullman, lead campaign strategist at SumOfUs.org.
 “WestJet CEO Gregg Saretsky has proven himself unfit to address these
concerns and it is time that he step down and the airline institute a
comprehensive overhaul of its sexual harassment and assault policies under
the leadership of a new CEO.”

SumOfUs.org, an international consumer watchdog with more than 650,000
members in Canada, launched a new petition campaign 10 days ago demanding
that WestJet CEO Gregg Saretsky resign his post over his continued failure
to address sexual assault claims within the airline. The petition argues
that Saretsky is unfit to lead WestJet due to his repeated failure to
provide a workplace where claims of sexual assault and rape are adequately
investigated and employees are protected.  The petition calls on the
company to replace Saretsky and immediately update and enforce its policies
regarding sexual harassment and assault, in order to adequately protect
survivors and ensure criminals are prosecuted.
