*Corporate Watchdog Slams Krispy Kreme Over Continued Reliance on
Irresponsibly Sourced Palm Oil*

*Nearly 100,000 Urge Krispy Kreme CEO to Stand By Sustainability Commitment
and Drop Palm Oil Provider Over Rainforest Destruction*

Nearly 100,000 members of SumOfUs, an international corporate watchdog, are
renewing pressure on Krispy Kreme over the company’s failure to act on it’s
no-deforestation commitment regarding the sourcing of palm oil used in the
donut and coffee giant’s products.  While Krispy Kreme agreed to change its
harmful palm oil policies by the end of 2016, the donut giant has since
refuses to cut ties with the IOI Group — a leading Malaysian palm oil
trader that has repeatedly failed to address complaints of deforestation
and human rights violations.

“Krispy Kreme’s continued use of unsustainable palm oil stands in contrast
to actions taken by other companies, such as Dunkin’ Donuts, Unilever,
Nestlé, Kellogg, Mars, and General Mills, who have all cut ties with the
controversial palm oil trader.  By sourcing conflict palm oil to fry its
donuts, Krispy Kreme is actively contributing to the slashing and burning
of carbon-rich rainforest,” said Hanna Thomas, Campaign Manager, at SumOfUs.

“IOI is a repeat offender that has been suspended twice from the Roundtable
on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in 6 years for deforestation, peatland
drainage, operating without proper licenses, failing to prevent fires in
its Indonesian concessions, and land conflict with local communities.

“Two years after thousands of SumOfUs members pushed Krispy Kreme to
publicly commit to sourcing deforestation-free palm oil, the time is long
overdue for the donut chain to live up to its values and take important
steps to protect Southeast Asia’s rainforests” added Thomas.
