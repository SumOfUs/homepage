*Crystal Pepsi Targeted by Consumer group & Environmentalists Over Ties to
Rainforest Deforestation*

*New Video Parodies 90s Crystal Pepsi Ads, Links Company to Destruction of
Rainforests in South East Asia*

*Thousands Urge PepsiCo to Fix Its Palm Oil Policy; Protect Indonesia’s
Rainforests and Workers*

As Crystal Pepsi hits shelves in the United States for the first time since
the 1990s, advocates from SumOfUs, an international consumer group are
calling on PepsiCo to amend its palm oil policy to help prevent rainforest
destruction and worker rights abuses associated with palm oil production in
Indonesia.

Coinciding with the launch of Crystal Pepsi in the US, SumOfUs has released
a new video ad parodying Crystal Pepsi ads from the 1990s and linking the
company to rainforest destruction in South East Asia.

SumOfUs plans to promote the parody ad on Facebook and Google and target
Pepsi customers and enthusiasts throughout the month of August.

In addition to the ad, more than 80,000 people in the United States and
around the world have signed onto a petition urging Pepsico to only use
responsible palm oil in its supply chain, and make sure that its palm oil
policy applies to its Indonesian producer, IndoFood.

“While PepsiCo makes juicy profits off this product relaunch, Indonesia’s
rainforest, workers, and endangered animals pay a heavy price. PepsiCo’s
palm oil policy contains a huge loophole -- it doesn’t cover its producer
in Indonesia, IndoFood,” *explained Katherine Tu, campaigner for SumOfUs.*
“PepsiCo buys over 470,000 metric tonnes of palm oil each year -- so much
that if you filled Pepsi cans with palm oil, there would be enough to wrap
around the entire world four times over.”

This cheap palm oil is used to produce PepsiCo products that line our
supermarket shelves. Products like Doritos, Cheetos, Quaker Granola Bars,
and Lay’s potato chips. The demand for palm oil is driving the clearing of
swathes of rainforest and carbon-rich peatlands. It’s making greenhouse gas
emissions skyrocket and it’s fuelling climate change. It’s pushing
endangered species like orangutans, elephants, and tigers to the brink of
extinction.  Many workers in the palm oil industry are paid little or
nothing at all -- especially women. Children are working on IndoFood
plantations. Some workers don’t have access to proper safety equipment, and
are exposed to highly toxic chemicals on a daily basis.

“A nostalgia for rollerblades and fanny packs is fine, but it's crystal
clear PepsiCo needs to open its eyes and realize we are no longer in the
1990's and deforestation, wildlife extinction and labor abuses are no
longer acceptable costs of doing business," *said Gemma Tillack, Senior
Agribusiness Campaigner with Rainforest Action Network. *"Since crystal
pepsi first launched in 1992, millions of acres of precious Indonesian
rainforests have been destroyed for palm oil, but 25 years later the
company continues to source palm oil from laggards that are clinging to
business as usual instead of producing truly responsible palm oil.”

SumOfUs has campaigned against PepsiCo’s use of unsustainable palm oil in
the past targeting brands ranging from Cheetos to Doritos to Pepsi True.
While PepsiCo announced a new palm oil policy earlier this year, SumOfUs
points out that the policy’s massive loophole for IndoFoods continues to
threaten rainforests, endangered animals and workers throughout South East
Asia.
