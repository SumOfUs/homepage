*Shareholders Resolution Calls for Amazon (NYSE: AMZN) to Address Worker
Abuse, Perform Human Rights Risk Assessment*

*Shareholders Join Corporate Watchdog in Urging Amazon.com Board of
Directors to Adopt Resolution Addressing Worker Abuse at Annual General
Meeting*

SEATTLE — Ahead of Amazon.com’s Annual General Meeting on Tuesday, May
17th,  Amazon.com shareholders are calling on the internet giant to adopt a
resolution addressing worker abuse by performing a human rights risk
assessment.

At the Annual General Meeting later this month, Lisa Lindsley, Capital
Markets Advisor for SumOfUs.org, an international corporate watchdog
organization, will present proxy resolution Item 4 - calling on Amazon.com
to “identify and analyze potential and actual human rights risk of Amazon’s
entire operations and supply chain.” The human rights risk resolution was
filed jointly by four individual SumOfUs members who are Amazon
shareholders.

The proposal is supported by proxy advisory firm ISS, which said, “Amazon
could provide additional information regarding the policies the company has
implemented to identify and assess human rights risks in its own operations
and the relevant mechanisms it has implemented to ensure compliance with
such policies. Such information would benefit shareholders, as it would
allow them to better understand and assess how the company is managing any
associated risks.”

“It is long past time that Amazon’s Board of Directors acknowledge and
address worker abuses within their supply chain and ensure that they are
following the law where they operate,” explained Lisa Lindsley,
representing SumOfUs at Amazon.com’s shareholder meeting later this month.
 “Providing this information is critically important to shareholders
seeking to assess how the company is managing risks associated with human
rights abuses and will compel Amazon executives to ensure that all workers
are treated fairly.”

"Amazon.com continues to use a supplier of security services for its
headquarters, Security Industry Specialists (SIS), that has ongoing
violations of Seattle's paid sick leave law and routinely harasses workers
seeking to exercise their right to freedom of association," said Sergio
Salinas, President of SEIU6 Property Services NW which represents security
officers in Seattle. "How can shareholders have confidence that the company
is managing human rights risks in its supply chain when they are not being
vigilant in their home town?"

Activists from SumOfUs will also deliver more than 104,930 signatures to
Amazon.com executives at the shareholder meeting, calling on the global
corporation to treat workers better and pay its share of taxes. The
petition was also signed by over 18,000 direct and indirect Amazon
shareholders, and nearly 73,000 Amazon customers.
