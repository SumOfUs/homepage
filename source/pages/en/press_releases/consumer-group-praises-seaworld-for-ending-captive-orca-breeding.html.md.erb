*SeaWorld Announces an End to Captive Orca Breeding*

SumOfUs: “Era of Cruel and Dangerous Captive Orca Displays is Coming to an
End”

Today, SeaWorld announced that it would be ending the captive breeding of
orcas at all SeaWorld facilities in the United States.  In reaction to the
announcement, Angus Wong, campaigner at SumOfUs, an international consumer
watchdog organization issued the following statement:

“Today’s announcement that SeaWorld will permanently end the captive
breeding of orcas is a major step in the right direction, one that signals
that the era of cruel and dangerous captive orca displays is coming to an
end.  And that end can’t come soon enough. Keeping and breeding large,
intelligent animals in small underwater cages for the sake of entertainment
and profit is simply unethical.  Consumers have woken up and sent a clear
message to SeaWorld that they won’t pay to watch animal cruelty in action.
It is encouraging that SeaWorld seems to have finally taken notice.”

More than 1.6 million SumOfUs members urged California lawmakers to take
action to stop SeaWorld’s orca abuse and enact the Orca Welfare and Safety
Act.

Since that campaign, SeaWorld has cancelled the orca "entertainment" show
in the face of public pressure and was barred from breeding whales in
capacity by the California Coastal Commission.

Last month, SumOfUs, an international consumer watchdog organization
launched a new online parody game that simulates the experiences of orcas
held in captivity at SeaWorld.  The game, Olivia the Orca, mockingly claims
“being a whale in capacity is *SO* much fun” and challenges the player to
swim for as long as they like.
