*Over 28,000 Call for Replacement of WestJet CEO Gregg Saretsky Over
Mishandling of Sexaul Assault Cases*

*SumOfUs to Deliver Shareholder Letter at WestJet Annual General Meeting in
Calgary*

CALGARY — On Tuesday, May 3rd, as WestJet shareholders gather for the the
airline's Annual General Meeting, Emma Pullman, lead campaign strategist at
SumOfUs, will be on-the-ground to ask questions and appeal to shareholders
to vote against reappointing CEO Gregg Saretsky over his failure to prevent
and adequately respond to sexual assault against WestJet flight
attendants.  She will also deliver a letter from shareholders calling on
WestJet’s Board Chair and Safety Health and Environment Committee Chair to
replace Saretsky.

The letter, addressed to Clive Beddoe, Chair of the Board, S Barry Jackson,
Chair of the Safety, Health and Environment Committees and Barbara Munroe,
Corporate Secretary, is being circulated to over 300 WestJet shareholders
who have called on Saretsky to resign.

Since news of the assaults broke, more than 28,000 Canadian members of
SumOfUs, an international corporate watchdog group, have signed onto a
petition calling for CEO Gregg Saretsky to step down, and for the company
to institute a comprehensive overhaul of their sexual harassment and
assault prevention and reporting procedures. Of the 28,000 Canadians who
have signed the SumOfUs petition, over 2,200 are frequent flyers, and
15,000 are WestJet customers.

The campaign comes after a lawsuit was filed in the B.C. Supreme Court on
March 1, 2016 in which the plaintiff in the suit, Mandalena Lewis, a flight
attendant at WestJet from 2008 to 2016, claimed that WestJet failed to
investigate or respond to her report of a sexual assault by a WestJet
pilot. WestJet took away the pilot's ability to fly to the location where
the assault took place, ostensibly taking away the ability of local
authorities to prosecute the assault.

Since Lewis filed her lawsuit in early March, at least eight additional
WestJet employees have come forward claiming they had also been sexual
assaulted by WestJet employees and that the airline failed to take action
to prosecute their attackers and prevent further sexual assaults.
