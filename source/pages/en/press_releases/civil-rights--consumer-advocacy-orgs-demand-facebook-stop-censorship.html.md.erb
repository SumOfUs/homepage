*Civil Rights & Consumer Advocacy Organizations Team Up Demanding Facebook
Stop Censorship of Personal Account Data at Police Request*

*After Police Killing of Korryn Gaines in Baltimore, Groups Push for
Facebook to Adopt Transparent, Publicly-Accountable Policies on Data
Censorship*

In a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, a coalition of 41 civil rights
and consumer advocacy organizations - including SumOfUs, Color Of Change,
The Daily Kos, and the Center for Media Justice - are demanding that he
clarify his company's position on the deactivation and censorship of Korryn
Gaines’ personal Facebook account at the request of police earlier this
month.

Gaines, a 23-year-old black woman, was killed by Baltimore County police on
Monday, August 1st.  Gaines, who was broadcasting the standoff that
ultimately led to her death and the injury of her 5-year-old son, had her
account deactivated by Facebook during the standoff, at the request of
police.

The letter, addressed to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg demands that the
social media giant:

1. Explain what happened that caused Facebook to shut down Korryn
   Gaines’ account, and to fully restore the account;

2. Clarify Facebook’s stance regarding collaboration with police and law
   enforcement to censor data and video; and

3. Institute a comprehensive policy regarding the censorship of content
   and video that protects individual civil liberties, and is transparent and
   accountable to the public.

“Mark Zuckerberg has been a notable supporter of the Black Lives Matter
movement and taken a stance on issues of racial justice in the United
States in the past few years. It was extremely troubling to see that
Facebook actively censored Korryn Gaines’ account and videos of her murder
by police at the request of law enforcement officials,” *explained Nicole
Carty, campaigner at SumOfUs. *“In recent years, social media and shareable
video have been instrumental in raising awareness about the ongoing
epidemic of police violence against people of color in the United States.
If Facebook decides that it will simply comply with police requests to
suspend broadcasts and accounts, it will be shielding police misbehavior
from public scrutiny and stifling free speech — not to mention cutting
people off from crucial support networks in the midst of deadly police
encounters.”

“By bowing to police demands to deactivate Korryn Gaines’s Facebook account
and livestream, Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook are complicit in silencing
victims of police violence. Livestreaming platforms like Facebook Live have
played a critical role in broadcasting Black voices and holding the police
accountable. But, when companies like Facebook compromise the integrity of
such platforms, they are burying our community's stories and potentially
participating in police cover ups that perpetuate this cycle of
violence,” *said
Rashad Robinson, Executive Director of Color Of Change.*  “If Facebook
truly believes that Black lives matter, it should stop censoring users at
the request of police. Facebook’s mission of making the world more open and
connected depends on Black voices being heard, not shut up and shut out.”

Earlier this month, 60,000 members of SumOfUs signed onto a petition to
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg asking him to clarify his company’s position
on the deactivation and censorship of personal profiles at the request of
police.  A similar petition from Color Of Change has been signed by 72,000
people.

"Mark Zuckerberg should take a moment to #SayHerName: Korryn Gaines. Yet
another Black life was lost to police violence.  While platforms like
Facebook and Instagram can't shield against the bullets, they've helped to
expose that reality of police violence against Black communities. Shutting
down Korryn Gaines' social media accounts at the request of police sets a
dangerous precedent for the relevance of this platform.  Facebook and its
CEO have said they value Black lives, but their actions must extend beyond
rhetoric. Silencing Black voices at the request of the police is a
contradiction to those stated values," *said Steven Renderos, Organizing
Director, Center for Media Justice.*

"The American public, and especially disadvantaged communities, have
benefitted most from the democratizing of media, using their phones and
social media to quickly spread the word about previously ignored
injustices. Shutting off those voices because the police or other people in
power are inconvenienced is unacceptable," *added Markos Moulitsas, founder
and publisher of Daily Kos*. "Facebook censored Korryn Gaines’ coverage of
her standoff with police, a standoff that led to her death. Facebook can be
a valuable resource in ending these tragedies, but only if it allows people
of color to highlight police abuses against their community. Hopefully,
Facebook can learn from this mistake and ensure, as a matter of corporate
policy, that such censorship never happens again."
