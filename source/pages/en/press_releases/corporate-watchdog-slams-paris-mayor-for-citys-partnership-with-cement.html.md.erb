Corporate Watchdog Slams Paris Mayor for City’s Partnership with Cement
Manufacturer Lafarge Amidst Allegations the Company is Paying ISIS to
Continue Operations in Syria

Nearly 40,000 Demand Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo Drop the French Industrial
Giant as Corporate Partner of Annual Summer Paris-Plages Event for Striking
Deal with Terrorist Group

Paris, France — Nearly 40,000 members of SumOfUs, an international
corporate watchdog organization, are calling on Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo to
cut the City’s ties with industrial company Lafarge for allegedly paying
ISIS to continue operating its cement plant in Jalabiya, Northern Syria.
The French industrial giant is the corporate partner and sand provider of
this year’s hugely popular Paris-Plages

urban beach summer event, run by the office of the Mayor of Paris that
creates temporary artificial beaches along the river Seine in the center of
Paris and the Bassin de la Villette in the northeast of Paris.

According to an investigative report by Le Monde

published last month, Lafarge entered into deals with armed groups in
Syria, including the Islamic State, in order to protect its cement works in
the country. The report reveals that between 2013 and 2014, Lafarge paid
taxes to Islamic State group middlemen for safe passage for its equipment
and employees in order to continue its business operations in Syria.

“Terrorists should never be business partners. It is beyond reprehensible
for Lafarge to be cutting deals with ISIS just for profits’ sake,” said
Eoin Dubsky, Campaign manager at SumOfUs. “By enriching the terrorist
group’s coffers with payments to continue its operations in Syria, LaFarge
is inadvertently supporting ISIS’ worldwide campaign of terror that has
left scores killed, displaced and under siege in one of the worst
humanitarian nightmares of our time.

“This is a scandalous partnership with the City of Paris that should have
never happened. By partnering with Lafarge for this summer’s Paris-Plages
event, the City of Paris is whitewashing the company’s obscene show of
corporate greed that profits off the war and violence created by
terrorists. It is high time to make Lafarge accountable for its support of
terror, which is why nearly 40,000 SumOfUs members are calling on Paris
Mayor Anne Hidalgo to cut ties with Lafarge once and for all. ”
