*New SeaWorld Parody Game Simulates Experience of Orcas in Captivity*

Earlier today, SumOfUs, an international consumer watchdog organization
launched a new online parody game that simulates the experiences of orcas
held in captivity at SeaWorld.  The game, Olivia the Orca, mockingly claims
“being a whale in capacity is *SO* much fun” and challenges the player to
swim for as long as they like.

“Keeping large, intelligent animals in small underwater cages is a cruel
form of torture that is unfortunately standard business practice for the
folks at SeaWorld,” explained Paul Ferris, campaign manager for
SumOfUs.org.  “SeaWorld has no excuse.  Consumers around the world known
that forcing intelligent, sensitive animals to live in cages for the sake
of entertainment and profit is simply unethical.  We hope that the Olivia
the Orca parody game hammers home just how cruel this practice is - and
convinces more people to call on SeaWorld to end their cruelty now.”

The game release comes days after SeaWorld admitted to having its workers
pose as animal rights activists to spy on and disrupt anti-SeaWorld
protests.

Last year, more than 1.6 million SumOfUs members urged California lawmakers
to take action to stop SeaWorld’s orca abuse and enact the Orca Welfare and
Safety Act.

Since that campaign, SeaWorld has cancelled the orca "entertainment" show in the
face of public pressure and was barred from breeding whales in capacity by
the California Coastal Commission.
