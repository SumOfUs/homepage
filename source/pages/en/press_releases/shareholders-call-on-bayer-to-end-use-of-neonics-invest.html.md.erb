*Shareholders Call on Bayer to End Use of Neonics, Invest in Alternatives
to Bee-Killing Pesticides*

*Shareholder motion draws attention to business risk of neonicotinoids
pesticides*

*GERMANY* —  SumOfUs.org, an international corporate watchdog, is ramping
up an ongoing anti-neonics campaign in anticipation of Bayer AG’s annual
general meeting on April 29th, urging the company to turn away from its
current use of neonicotinoids (or “neonics”), a class of systemic
pesticides linked to dangerous declines in pollinating species, like bees,
along with negative impacts to other animals, land and water.

At the April 29th meeting in Cologne, the SumOfUs delegation will present
signatures from over one million individuals worldwide as well as speak to
an official shareholder counter-motion that directly questions Bayer’s
investment in neonics. In the countermotion against Bayer executives,
concerned shareholders allege that the company’s use of neonics contradicts
policies regarding the health and safety of employees, neighbors,
customers, consumers, and the environment.

“Bayer’s reliance on the revenues from neonics impairs the long term value
of Bayer shares. There is growing worldwide opposition mounting against the
use of neonicotinoids that Bayer cannot continue to ignore,” *said SumOfUs
campaigner, **Anne Isakowitsch*. “Instead of investing significant
resources to counter these very legitimate concerns, Bayer should be
commissioning research to alternatives that are not as toxic.”

“In its policy on sustainability, Bayer claims that future viability and
that lasting commercial success is only possible if we balance economic
growth with ecological and social responsibility. In the case of
neonicotinoids, Bayer is clearly putting its principles aside to seek short
term profits.”

Mounting concern from scientific research and customer preferences to ban
neonics are reaching a tipping point. In December 2013, the European Union
enacted a two-year ban on three neonics. In March 2016, the French
Parliament approved a ban on neonics. Two of Canada’s provinces, Ontario
and Quebec, have neonic bans in place -- one of which just won when
appealed in court. Maryland, a U.S. state, is expected to pass a bill
banning stores from selling products laced with neonicotinoids. Scotts
MiracleGro, a major US pesticide company,  has also indicated it is phasing
out bee-harming pesticides.
