## How We Use Your Information



## Signing Petitions and Sending Emails

When you sign a petition or complete a survey on our Site, we consider your name, city, state/province and comments as public information.  For example, we may provide compilations of petitions, with your comments, to the public official, company or person to whom the petition is addressed, and/or to the press and/or public online.We will not, however, make your street address publicly available, although we may transmit it to the recipient of the petition. In addition, we may disclose your email address to the recipient of a petition. As a result, you may receive an email response directly from the recipient of the petition. SumOfUs is not responsible for further use of your e-mail address by the recipient of a petition.

We will also use your first name to indicate on the Site that you have taken action.

## Donations and Credit Card Information

When you contribute to SumOfUs online, we collect credit card information from you. That information is used solely for processing your contribution; it is not maintained by SumOfUs; and is never disclosed to anyone, for any other purpose other than for processing your contribution. When contributing through an express donation, your card details are stored by our payment provider, [Braintree Payments](https://www.braintreepayments.com/en-au/products-and-features/data-security) (owned by Paypal), who places a huge emphasis on security and handles billions of dollars in payments every year. 

## Security

SumOfUs uses industry standard security measures to protect the information collected by this Site, but we cannot guarantee complete security.

## Children

SumOfUs does not knowingly solicit personally identifying information from children under 13 years of age. We will promptly remove any personal information from children under 13 upon notice to us.

## Advertising

We may place online advertising with third-party vendors, including Google, which will be shown on other sites on the internet. In some cases, those third-party vendors may decide which ads to show you based on your prior visits to the Site. At no time will you be personally identified to those third-party vendors, nor will any of the personal information you share with us be shared with those third-party vendors. If you prefer to opt out of the use of these third-party cookies on the Site, you can do so by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page.

## Cookies and Data Tracking

In order to better serve our supporters, we use cookies and periodically analyze web logs.  Some cookies are used to prepopulate forms for you so that on repeat visits to the Site you don’t need to reenter certain information.  You can set your browser to disable cookies, but then you would not have the advantage of having certain sections of forms being prepopulated for you, and you may not be able to access certain parts of the Site.  We may also use third-party services such as Google Analytics. This helps us understand traffic patterns and know if there are problems with our Site. We may also use embedded images in emails to track open rates for our mailings, so that we can tell which mailings appeal most to SumOfUs supporters.

The information generated by a cookie about your use of our Site (including your IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where Google is legally required, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google can combine your IP address with any other data held by Google. By using this Site, you consent to the processing of data by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.

URLs contained in emails may contain an ID that enables us to correctly identify the person who takes an action using a web page. We use these URLs to simplify the process of signing petitions and filling out surveys. We may occasionally present a shortened URL that references a longer URL which you can see in the browser’s address bar when you access the page.

## Links to Other Sites

This Privacy Policy does not apply to ANY external links or any website not owned and operated by SumOfUs. Third party sites will have their own policies which may be different from ours and we recommend that you check the privacy policy of each site that you visit.

## Disclosure of Information

SumOfUs will challenge any attempt to gain access to the information you give us by government agencies or private organizations. In the unlikely event that we are required by law to disclose any of your information we will do our best to contact you first so that you may have the opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will also independently object to any requests for access to information about users of our Site that we believe to be improper.
