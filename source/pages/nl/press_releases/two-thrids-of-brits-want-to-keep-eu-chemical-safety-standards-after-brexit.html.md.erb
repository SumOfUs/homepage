UNITED KINGDOM -- Nearly two-thirds (63%) of British citizens, including 62% of Leave voters - believe that there should be no reduction in regulatory standards that protect people and the environment from potentially harmful chemicals when the UK leaves the EU, according to a new poll conducted on behalf of SumOfUs and CHEM Trust by GQR Research. [1]

As Brexit negotiations continue amid debates within the Cabinet over whether the UK should maintain EU regulatory standards or adopt a low-regulation landscape to attract business, it is clear that the the British public, whether they voted leave or remain, want to maintain current protections from potentially harmful chemicals.

Britain is currently a member of the EU's REACH system, which aims to ensure that all substances used and sold throughout the EU are safe for people and the environment [2]. It covers chemicals contained in thousands of everyday products, from furniture to till receipts to detergents. As with all EU level regulations, whether UK citizens will continue to enjoy protection from the world’s most comprehensive chemicals regulation system is currently in doubt.

CHEM Trust Executive Director Dr Michael Warhurst said:

“This survey shows that the public - whether Remain or Leave voters - do not want any reduction in the regulations that protect people and the environment from potentially harmful  chemicals after Brexit. The only way to be sure of achieving this objective for the UK to stay in the EU’s chemicals regulatory system REACH after Brexit - and it is possible for the UK to be in REACH but not in the EU, as Norway is.”

SumOfUs campaigner Sondhya Gupta said:

‘It’s easy to forget that we all come into contact with chemicals in everyday products, and this survey shows that there is massive support among both Leave and Remain voters for strong regulations to ensure that companies use safer chemicals. Indeed, 83% of Leave voters supported companies having to use safer alternatives to chemicals with serious hazards. It’s clear that there is no appetite for post-Brexit UK to become a low regulation corporate free for all’ [3]

The results come on the eve of a major conference on chemicals regulation post-brexit, organised by Chemical Watch. The conference, on Friday 29th September in London [4], brings together experts from industry, governments and NGOs to examine the implications of Brexit in terms of UK/EU trade and environmental protection, current models of cooperation with the EU and possible options for UK chemicals law after Brexit.

[3] When asked to choose between the following two statements, 83% of Leave voters and 84% of Remain voters said that the first statement was closer to their views than the second.

Statement 1: “Where there is evidence that a chemical has serious hazards, companies should have to use safer alternatives if they are available.” or

Statement 2:“Companies should be able to use or sell any substances as long as they believe the risk associated with them is low or manageable.”
