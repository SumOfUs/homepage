SumOfUs Slams Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi's  'Non-Apology' Today after London Transport Authority Revokes the Company's License to Operate in the City

Consumer Group Applauds London Mayor Sadiq Khan for 'Keeping Uber Accountable'

Following the decision on Friday by London's transport authority not to renew Uber's license to operate in the city, new Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has published a letter in the Evening Standard today apologising for the company's 'mistakes.' In the letter, Khosrowshahi writes: “While Uber has revolutionised the way people move in cities around the world, it's equally true that we've got things wrong along the way. On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, I apologise for the mistakes we've made.”

London mayor Sadiq Khan told the BBC today that he welcomes Khosrowshahi's apology, but said that Uber had brought “unfair pressure” on TfL, employing an “army” of PR experts and lawyers.” The mayor said: “I want companies that abide by the rules, I want companies that innovate, harbour new technologies, I want disruptive technology coming to London but you've got to play by the rules.”

On Friday, Transport for London (TfL) announced that Uber's application for a new operation license has been rejected on the basis that the company is not a “fit and proper” operator.

In reaction to the news, Eoin Dubsky campaigner at SumOfUs, a global consumer watchdog, released the following statement:

“Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi's 'apology' today is a weak attempt to clean up the company's dirty act after the city of London made it clear that it can no longer operate above the law. There is no way to sugarcoat Uber's 'mistakes': They are egregious in scale and represent systematic, predatory corporate practices that have for too long trampled on the rights of its drivers and users. From raking in massive profits from the labor of their drivers while denying them basic workers' rights, to its lack of corporate responsibility, Uber must do more than simply apologise to win back London's trust.

“We applaud London mayor Sadiq Khan for keeping Uber accountable by telling the company in no uncertain terms that it cannot go on behaving as if it is above the law forever. If Uber wants to truly make amends, it must ensure that drivers' rights and public safety are included in any future license.”

On Monday, September 18th, GMB joined forces with SumOfUs to hand in a 106,000-signature petition to London City Hall. GMB and SumofUs have gathered more than 106,000 public signatures asking TfL not to renew the license unless Uber guarantees safe working practices and basic employment rights to its drivers.

72% of Londoners, and 73% of Uber users believe that Transport for London (TfL) should require Uber to guarantee safeguards such as minimum wage and paid holidays for their drivers, according to a poll of adults in London conducted by YouGov on behalf of consumer watchdog SumOfUs. [1]

In April, SumOfUs launched a website (http://www.whyeveryonehatesuber.com) documenting Uber's global pattern of driver mistreatment, corporate bullying, and legal transgressions. The website employs an interactive map, organising Uber's many issues around the world by country, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Denmark, France, India, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, China, Japan, and more.
