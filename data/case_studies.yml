- lead: "Protecting animals from inhumane treatment"
  details: "Corporations don't just exploit humans - they exploit animals too. Whether it's stopping the sale of angora rabbit fur, forcing SeaWorld to stop breeding orcas, or convincing every major airline to prohibit the transport of hunting trophy carcasses, we've stood up for the rights of animals, and we'll do it again."
