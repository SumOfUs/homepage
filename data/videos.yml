  title: Clearview AI ends facial recognition software in Canada
  desc: Clearview AI will stop offering its facial-recognition services in Canada in response to an investigation by the federal privacy commissioner. We‚Äôre celebrating the indefinite suspension of Clearview AI‚Äôs contract with the RCMP ‚úäüèø. Now SumOfUs members are fighting to force Clearview AI out of our social networks as well. Twitter, Google, Youtube and LinkedIn have already told Clearview to stop scraping photos or face legal action, and Apple has blocked the app. If thousands of us call on Facebook to take legal action against Clearview AI, we can stop this dystopian future before it starts.
