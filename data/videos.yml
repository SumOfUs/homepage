  title: Facebook - DO YOUR JOB
  desc: This is a critical time for democracy. The US election is days away and Facebook is still allowing the spread of disinformation to churn out lies, propaganda, and conspiracy theories. But we still have time to force them to clean up their act. We’re demanding Facebook DO THEIR JOB in ensuring their platform is not used to incite violence or undermine the Election outcome both before Election Day and beyond. #DoYourJob #StopDisinfo

  title: Clearview AI ends facial recognition software in Canada
  desc: Clearview AI will stop offering its facial-recognition services in Canada in response to an investigation by the federal privacy commissioner. We’re celebrating the indefinite suspension of Clearview AI’s contract with the RCMP ✊🏿. Now SumOfUs members are fighting to force Clearview AI out of our social networks as well. Twitter, Google, Youtube and LinkedIn have already told Clearview to stop scraping photos or face legal action, and Apple has blocked the app. If thousands of us call on Facebook to take legal action against Clearview AI, we can stop this dystopian future before it starts.
